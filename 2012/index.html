          <p align="left">Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors, </p>
          <p align="left"><strong>3 hectic days. 27 hours of conferencing. Many sleepless nights.  One great success.<br />
            Our primary objective was to provide  the delegates with the best possible environment to reach consensus on some of  the most relevant and heated topics today. The response was far beyond what we  had ever imagined. <br />
            Here is a short sum-up of the committee sessions:
            <br />
            Debating it out diplomatically, the  Disarmament and International Security Committee was able to successfully reach  a consensus on two crises; one regarding the NATO attack on Afghanistan and the  other regarding the North Korean dispatch of nuclear missiles to South Korea.  The delegates quickly lobbied and merged and eventually a resolution was passed  with Afghanistan, India, North Korea and Uganda as the main submitters.<br />
            In the Human Rights Commission an  agreement was reached by member states on the issue of rehabilitation of child  soldiers and censorship and freedom of expression in the light of the new  media. The crisis the Commission encountered was the assassination of the  President of the Sri Lankan civil society. The Commission efficiently worked  together to draw up a successful resolution.</strong></p>
          <p align="left"><strong><br />
            The Economic and Social Council, on  the very first day, was faced with the challenge of coming up with a resolution  that would address India&rsquo;s unhealthy air pollution levels. Not only was a  remarkable resolution presented, but the Council voted with overwhelming  majority for the resolution and it was successfully adopted.<br />
            Not to be outdone, the members of the  Security Council debated passionately to reach a consensus on the issues at  hand. I must say, there was never a dull moment. With the USA and China both  determined not to back down, we observers were apprehensive that a resolution  would ever be passed. However, the Council found an effective solution to the  set agenda of &lsquo;Right to Intervene&rsquo;. The Security Council was also challenged  with another crisis on the second day. The crisis was NATO airstrikes on  Palestine and Syria. After heated debates and recurrent flirtations with Veto,  a comprehensive resolution was unanimously agreed upon. This resolution  effectively calls for the implementation of the two-state-solution in the  Middle East and the creation of an internationally recognised State of  Palestine.</strong></p>
          <p align="left"><strong><br />
            The topics set and the crises that were introduced really tested  the ability of the delegates to think on their feet. I must mention that there  were a few delegates who really stepped up to the challenge and although under  tremendous pressure, were able to keep calm and reach an agreeable solution. <br />
            The conference would not have been made possible if it weren&rsquo;t for  our dedicated team of volunteers. From the  Chief Guests, Principal and Vice-Principals for their constant support, Faculty  Advisors, Teachers, Director General, Support Staff, Operations Team, Training  and Research team, Media Team, Committee Heads and Co-Heads, Special Committee  Officials, Pages, to the rest of the CAMUN Officials who worked tirelessly to  make sure the session ran smoothly. Last but not the least, all the delegates,  from Al Ain Junior British School, Modern High School, Our Own English High  School and the Cambridge High School who represented their countries with such  fervour and passion that they <em>literally</em> brought the House down.</strong></p>
          <p align="left"><strong><br />
            To everyone who attended, thank you for the wonderful memories and  contributing to the &quot;best-ever&quot; CAMUN conference so far.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>All in all, it was truly an event to remember.&nbsp;<br />
            On a final note, I strongly believe  the conference also taught us that it is possible for countries to work  together and find solutions that are in the interests of all nations. I believe  it has also taught us that if we are determined never to give up, we can  constantly challenge ourselves to find opportunities and solutions that help make  our world a better place. Our voice matters. Let us not get complacent and  settle for anything less but relentlessly strive to make each new day a better  one for the next generation. As tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders, we have within us the  ability to create the future.<br />
            Circumstances should never define  us; rather how we respond to them should.<br />
            Hope to see you all next year,<br />
      </strong></p>
